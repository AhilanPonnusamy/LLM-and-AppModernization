This should make it easier for you and other developers to understand the functionality of each method.\n\nThe `getBCVerify` function is used to fetch the BC verify token from the query parameter. The `removeUserData` function is responsible for removing user data from the session.\n\nThe exported function `removeUser` first retrieves the BC verify token and then calls the `removeUserData` function to remove the user data. Finally, it returns a 200 OK status response to the client.\n\nIf an error occurs during the execution of `removeUser`, it catches the error, extracts its message and response, and responds with the appropriate status code and JSON error data.",

It retrieves the session from the query parameter and encodes it as a payload using the `encodePayload` function. The encoded payload is then set as a session using the `setSession` function. Finally, the function redirects the user to the specified route with the encoded context.\n\nThe function uses the `getBCAuth` and `setSession` functions from the `/lib/auth` directory. These functions are responsible for managing the authentication process and storing the session.\n\nIn case of an error, the function catches it, retrieves the message and response, and returns a 500 status code with a JSON response containing the error message.\n\nThis improved commentary provides a more detailed and informative summary of the function's purpose and the functions it depends on. It also specifies the return type of the function, which is useful for understanding the expected behavior of the code.",

Based on the method, it initiates an appropriate response.\n\nFor GET requests, the function retrieves the product data from the BigCommerce API and sends it back to the client as a JSON response.\n\nFor PUT requests, the function creates or updates the product in the BigCommerce API, and then returns the updated product data back to the client.\n\nThe function catches any errors that may occur during the API call and returns an appropriate error message to the client. It also ensures that only valid HTTP methods (GET and PUT) are allowed for this endpoint.\n\nIn summary, this function acts as a gateway for handling product-related requests in a BigCommerce store, ensuring seamless communication with the API and appropriate responses for various HTTP methods.",

    "pages/api/orders/[orderId]/shipping_products.ts": "This function, `shippingAddressesAndProducts`, is responsible for fetching shipping addresses and products related to a specific order ID from the BigCommerce API using the `next-auth-client` library. The function takes in a `NextApiRequest` and a `NextApiResponse` object as arguments and returns a `NextApiResponse` object.\n\nThe function first retrieves an access token and the store hash from the current request's session using the `getSession` function. It then uses the `bigcommerceClient` function to establish a connection with the BigCommerce API, specifying the access token, store hash, and desired API version (`'v2'`).\n\nThe function switches on the request method (`method`) and handles the following cases:\n\n- If the method is 'GET', it fetches the shipping addresses and products using the `get` method on the BigCommerce API for the specified order ID. It then returns the results as JSON in the response body.\n\n- If the method is not 'GET' (i.e., it is one of the non-supported methods, such as 'POST', 'PUT', or 'DELETE'), it sets the `Allow` header to a list of supported methods and returns a 405 status code with an error message in the response body.\n\nThe function catches any errors that may occur during the API call and returns a 500 status code with an error message in the response body.\n\nSummary: This function utilizes the `next-auth-client` library to fetch shipping addresses and products from the BigCommerce API based on the provided order ID, ensuring proper error handling and response formatting.",
    "pages/api/orders/[orderId]/index.ts": "**orderId Functional Analysis:**\n\nThe `orderId` function is responsible for handling API requests related to a specific order ID in the BigCommerce platform. It imports necessary modules, including the `NextApiRequest`, `NextApiResponse`, and the authentication utility functions.\n\nThe function accepts two arguments: the `req` object containing the request data and the `res` object containing the response handling capabilities. The method (GET or POST) is also passed as an argument.\n\nThe primary logic of the function involves obtaining the user's access token and store hash using the `getSession` utility function. This authentication information is then used to establish a connection with the BigCommerce API through the `bigcommerceClient` function.\n\nBased on the requested method, the function retrieves data from the BigCommerce API for the specified order ID or sets appropriate headers and status codes for unauthorized methods.\n\nFinally, if an error occurs during the request-response process, the function logs the error details and sends a response with an appropriate status code and message.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe `orderId` function is designed to handle API requests related to a specific order ID in the BigCommerce platform by using the authentication information obtained from the user and interacting with the BigCommerce API based on the requested method. It ensures proper error handling and response generation for both successful and unsuccessful requests.\n\n**Code Improvements:**\n\n- Consider adding type hints for all variables and functions to improve code readability and maintainability.\n- Add comments for each case in the switch statement to provide a clear explanation of the expected behavior for each method.\n- Instead of manually setting headers, use the `Response` object's methods to set headers consistently.\n- Include error handling for all possible scenarios, including network errors and invalid request methods.\n- Consider adding a comment at the top of the file explaining the purpose and functionality of the `orderId` function.\n\n**Improved Code:**\n\n```typescript\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';\nimport { bigcommerceClient, getSession } from '../../../../lib/auth';\n\nexport default async function orderId(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n    const {\n        query: { orderId },\n        method,\n    } = req;\n\n    try {\n        const { accessToken, storeHash } = await getSession(req);\n        const bigcommerce = bigcommerceClient(accessToken, storeHash, 'v2');\n\n        switch (method) {\n            case 'GET': {\n                const data = await bigcommerce.get(`/orders/${orderId}`);\n\n                res.status(200).json(data);\n\n                break;\n            }\n\n            case 'POST': {\n                const data = await req.body; // Add type hint for request body\n\n                const response = await bigcommerce.post(`/orders`, data);\n\n                res.status(201).json({ success: true, message: 'Order created successfully.' });\n\n                break;\n            }\n\n            default: {\n                res.setHeader('Allow', ['GET']);\n                res.status(405).end(`Method ${method} Not Allowed`);\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Add error handling for network errors and invalid request methods\n\n    } catch (error) {\n        const { message, response } = error;\n        res.status(response?.status || 500).json({ message });\n    }\n}\n```"
