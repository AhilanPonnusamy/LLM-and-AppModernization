## jest.config.js

This JavaScript/TypeScript code defines an object that contains configuration settings for a Jest testing framework. The purpose of this configuration is to manage and organize test files, modules, and dependencies.

Key functions of this code include:

1. **testRegex**: This function specifies the pattern for test files, which includes directories like 'test', 'src', and 'pages' along with file extensions '.jsx?', '.tsx?', '.js', and '.json'.
2. **moduleFileExtensions**: This property lists the file extensions that are considered as test files, allowing Jest to recognize and process them accordingly.
3. **moduleNameMapper**: This function maps module names to their corresponding paths, which helps Jest locate and load required modules. It includes mappings for components, libs, mocks, pages, test utils, and types.
4. **coverageDirectory**: This property specifies the directory where Jest will store coverage information about the tested code.
5. **setupFilesAfterEnv**: This function specifies a file named 'jest.setup.ts' that should be executed after the environment has been set up.
6. **testEnvironment**: This property sets the testing environment to 'jsdom', which allows Jest to use a JavaScript implementation of a browser for running tests.

This configuration object is typically used in a `package.json` file or as a module exported from a script file, allowing other scripts to utilize these settings when running Jest tests.

## db.js

This JavaScript/TypeScript code defines a set of functions to interact with a MySQL database using the `mysql2` library. The code requires the `mysql2`, `util`, and `dotenv` packages, which are installed via npm or yarn.

The `usersCreate` and `storesCreate` functions create tables in the database for managing user information and store data, respectively. These functions use the `query` function from the `mysql2` library to execute SQL commands.

The `storeUsersCreate` function creates a table called "storeUsers" that stores information about users and their associated stores. It includes a unique index on both the user ID and store hash to ensure data integrity.

The code uses the `Promise.all` function to execute all three database creation commands asynchronously in parallel. Once all tables have been created, the connection is closed using the `connection.end()` function.

In summary, this code sets up a MySQL database and creates necessary tables for managing user information and store data. It then closes the connection after all tables have been created.

The key functions in this code include:

1. Importing required libraries and configuring environment variables using `dotenv`.
2. Creating table definitions using the `query` function from the `mysql2` library.
3. Executing multiple SQL commands asynchronously using `Promise.all`.
4. Closing the database connection using `connection.end()`.

This code can be used as a starting point for building a web application that interacts with a MySQL database using JavaScript or TypeScript.

## bcSdk.js

This JavaScript code is part of a BigCommerce SDK integration for a web application. The purpose of this script is to load the BigCommerce SDK asynchronously, ensuring that it's only loaded when needed and after other critical scripts have finished loading. This approach helps improve the overall performance and user experience of the application.

The code first checks if the `window` object is available, which means the script is running in a browser environment. If the window is not available, the script returns immediately.

Next, the script creates a `script` element with an ID of `bigcommerce-sdk-js`. It then uses the `getElementsByTagName` method to find the first existing `<script>` element in the document (referred to as `bcjs`). If such an element exists, it skips creating a new one.

Once the `<script>` element is created, it sets its `async` attribute to true and its `src` attribute to the URL of the BigCommerce SDK JavaScript file, which is `https://cdn.bigcommerce.com/jssdk/bc-sdk.js`. The `parentNode.insertBefore` method is then used to insert the new `<script>` element just before the existing one (referenced as `bcjs`).

The script also defines a global variable `window.bcAsyncInit` and assigns it a function that, when called, initializes the BigCommerce SDK using the `Bigcommerce.init` method. The `onLogout` function is passed as an argument to this initialization method. This function is defined to be called whenever the user logs out of the application.

In summary, this JavaScript code loads the BigCommerce SDK asynchronously, ensuring that it's only loaded when needed and after other critical scripts have finished loading. It also sets up a global variable and function to handle the initialization of the SDK and the logout event.

## next-env.d.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code is a Next.js project setup script, which is automatically generated by the Next.js CLI (Command Line Interface). The script uses TypeScript as the primary language and references the `next` and `next/image-types/global` types to ensure proper type checking and compatibility with the Next.js framework.

The purpose of this script is to establish the project's dependencies, configurations, and settings, allowing developers to create a well-organized and maintainable Next.js application. It imports necessary types and sets up various project-wide configurations, such as:

1. Compiling TypeScript into JavaScript for the client-side runtime.
2. Enabling hot module replacement (HMR) for faster reloading of changed files.
3. Configuring the `next` middleware to handle routing and server-side rendering (SSR).
4. Setting up image handling using the `next/image-types/global` type, which provides additional functionality for working with images in a Next.js application.

Key functions of this script:

1. Importing necessary types from the `next` and `next/image-types/global` packages.
2. Configuring the project's build process using the `createApp” function from the `next` type.
3. Setting up the project's middleware and routing using the `getInitialProps` and `render` functions.
4. Configuring image handling using the `useImage` hook from the `next/image-types/global` package.

Usage:

This script should not be manually edited, as it is automatically generated by the Next.js CLI when creating a new project. However, you can view and modify the generated code in the `pages`, `components`, or other files within your project directory. The script's primary role is to ensure that the project is set up correctly and consistently across all components and pages.

By following Best Practices and guidelines from the Next.js documentation, you can leverage the power of this script to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable Next.js applications.

## jest.setup.ts

This JavaScript code is part of a test suite using Jest, a popular testing framework for JavaScript. The code extends the `expect` function from `@testing-library/jest-dom`, which provides additional matchers and functions for working with DOM elements and React components.

The `afterEach` function is used to execute a cleanup process after each test in the suite. This is important because it helps to ensure that any mocks, temporary state, or other resources created during the test are properly reset and available for the next test.

In this specific code, the `afterEach` function calls `jest.clearAllMocks()` to reset all mocks created during the tests. This is useful when testing components that may depend on mocked APIs or other external dependencies.

Additionally, the code uses the `cleanup` utility function from `@test/utils` to remove any temporary files or state generated during the test. This helps to maintain a clean and organized test environment, making it easier to identify and reproduce issues.

To use this code in your own tests, you can import it at the beginning of your test file and make sure to call `cleanup()` before the test suite is executed. For example:

```javascript
import { cleanup } from '@test/utils';

// ... other test functions ...

afterEach(() => {
  cleanup();
});

describe('My Component', () => {
  // ... test functions ...
});
```

By using this code, you can ensure that your tests are well-organized, clean, and easy to maintain.

## data.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code defines several interfaces that represent different data structures used in a form, table, and list.

1. `FormData`: This interface represents a form data structure, which includes properties for description, isVisible, name, price, and type. These properties are used to store and manipulate data related to a form element.

2. `TableItem`: This interface represents a table item, which includes properties for id, name, price, and stock. These properties are used to store and manipulate data related to a table cell.

3. `ListItem`: This interface is an extension of the `FormData` interface, adding an `id` property. It is used to represent a list item, which can be used to store and manage data in a list view.

4. `StringKeyValue`: This interface is a simple key-value pair store, allowing you to map strings to strings. It can be used to store custom properties or metadata on any of the other interfaces.

These interfaces help to establish clear and consistent naming conventions for different data structures in your codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain. They also enable you to create and manipulate these data structures in a way that is consistent with their intended use.

To use these interfaces, you can create instances of them and populate them with data as needed. For example, you might create a `TableItem` instance and set its properties based on data from a database or an API. You could then use this instance to render a table in a user interface.

Similarly, you might create an instance of the `FormData` interface and populate it with data from a form submission. You could then use this instance to validate the form data and process it further.

By using these interfaces, you can ensure that your data structures are consistent, well-defined, and easy to work with, regardless of where they come from or how they are used.
---

## order.ts

This code defines several interfaces in TypeScript, which are blueprints for types that you can use when working with JavaScript. The interfaces are used to specify the structure and type of data that should be stored in certain parts of your application.

1. **BillingAddress**: This interface defines the properties for a billing address, including first_name, last_name, street_1, street_2, city, state, zip, and country.
2. **ShippingAddress**: This interface defines the properties for a shipping address, which are identical to the billing address properties.
3. **OrderProduct**: This interface defines the properties for an order product, including id, name, quantity, order\_address\_id, and two optional properties: discount\_amount and customer\_locale.
4. **Order**: This interface defines the properties for an order, including billing\_address (which is an instance of the BillingAddress interface), currency\_code, customer\_locale, discount\_amount, id, items\_total, order\_source, payment\_status, status, subtotal\_ex\_tax, shipping\_cost\_ex\_tax, total\_inc\_tax, and total\_tax.
5. **ShippingAndProductsInfo**: This interface defines the properties for an array of shipping addresses and an array of order products.

These interfaces help ensure that data is stored consistently and predictably across your application. They also enable code generation tools, such as TypeScript Compiler or Visual Studio Code's TypeScript Extension, to provide type-ahead assistance and error checking when working with these types.
---

## index.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code exports all the exported modules and their contents using the ES6 module syntax. The purpose of this code is to make it easier to import specific components or features from the `src` directory into another file.

Key functions:

1. `export *`: This keyword is used to export all the exported members (functions, classes, etc.) from a module. In this case, it exports all the modules listed in the code, including `auth`, `data`, `db`, `error`, and `order`.
2. `./auth`, `./data`, `./db`, `./error`, and `./order`: These are the directories and files containing the exported members. The code lists all these directories and exports every member (function, class, etc.) that has been explicitly declared as `exported` using the `export` keyword.

Usage:

To import specific components or features from this code into another file, you can use the following syntax:

```javascript
import { auth } from './auth';
import { data } from './data';
import { db } from './db';
import { error } from './error';
import { order } from './order';
```

By importing these modules, you can easily access the functions and classes they contain in your other files. This code organization pattern promotes modularity and makes it easier to manage and maintain large-scale projects.
---

## error.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code defines two interfaces: `ErrorProps` and `ErrorMessageProps`.

1. **ErrorProps**: This interface extends the built-in `Error` class and adds an optional `status` property. The purpose of this interface is to provide a standardized way to pass error information to child components or other parts of the application. By using this interface, you ensure that the error data is consistent and can be easily accessed and processed.

Key functions:
- `status`: The status code of the error.

Usage: You can use this interface when passing error objects from a parent component to a child component. For example:
```javascript
const errorProps = {
  error: new Error('An error occurred'),
  status: 500,
};

<ChildComponent error={errorProps} />
```
2. **ErrorMessageProps**: This interface defines the props that a component receiving error messages should use. It includes an optional `renderPanel` property, which indicates whether the error message should be displayed in a dedicated error panel or not. The purpose of this interface is to provide a consistent way to handle and display error messages throughout the application.

Key functions:
- `error`: The error object as defined by the `ErrorProps` interface.
- `renderPanel`: A boolean indicating whether the error message should be displayed in a dedicated panel or not.

Usage: You can use this interface when creating a component that handles error messages. For example:
```javascript
const ErrorMessageComponent = ({ error, renderPanel }) => {
  if (renderPanel) {
    <ErrorPanel />;
  }
  return <ErrorMessage />;
};

<ErrorMessageComponent error={error} />
```
In summary, these interfaces help maintain a consistent way to handle and pass error information throughout the application. By using them, you ensure that error data is accessible and can be processed in a standardized manner, making it easier to manage and respond to errors in your JavaScript/TypeScript application.

1. `SessionProps`: This interface represents the properties of a session object, which includes an access token, scope, and store hash.
2. `StoreData`: This interface stores the essential data for a specific store, such as the access token, scope, and store hash.
3. `UserData`: This interface contains user-related information, including the email and optional username.
4. `Db`: This interface represents an abstraction for managing database operations. It includes functions to check if a user is already stored in the database, set user and store data, retrieve store tokens, delete users and stores, and more.

The primary purpose of this code is to provide a consistent and reusable interface for handling user data and store information in a server-side application. By defining these interfaces, developers can ensure that the application follows a clear and predictable structure for managing user and store data.

Key functions:

* `getStoreToken(storeId: string): Promise<string> | null`: Retrieves the access token associated with a specific store id.
* `deleteStore(session: SessionProps): Promise<void>`: Deletes the store associated with a given session props object.
* `deleteUser(session: SessionProps): Promise<void>`: Deletes the user associated with a given session props object.
* `setStore(session: SessionProps): Promise<void>`: Sets the store associated with a given session props object.
* `setStoreUser(session: SessionProps): Promise<void>`: Sets the user associated with a given session props object and stores it in the database.
* `hasStoreUser(storeHash: string, userId: string): Promise<boolean> | boolean`: Checks if a user with a specific user id is already associated with a store with a specific store hash.

Usage: In a server-side application, these interfaces and functions can be used within a Node.js or TypeScript environment to manage user data and store information. For example, the `setStoreUser` function would be called when a new user logs in, and the `hasStoreUser` function would be called to check if the user is already associated with a store. The `getStoreToken` function would be called to retrieve the access token for a specific store.

By using these interfaces and functions, developers can ensure that the application follows a consistent and predictable structure for managing user and store data, making it easier to maintain and expand the application in the future.

By using these interfaces, developers can ensure that data is consistently represented and accessed throughout the application, improving overall code quality and maintainability.
---

## hooks.ts

This code is written in TypeScript and uses Jest mock functions to generate a table with mock data. The purpose of this code is to create a simple setup for testing a component that uses the `react-pdf` library to render a table.

The `useProducts` function is a mock function that returns a summary object containing inventory and variant counts. This summary is then passed to the `TableItem` component as a prop.

The `useProductList` function is another mock function that generates a list of TableItems with mock data, simulating a list of products. It returns an array of TableItems and a metadata object containing pagination information.

The `useProductInfo` function is a mock function that returns a single product object with some sample data. This product object is then passed to the `TableItem` component as a prop.

The code also defines global constants for the number of rows, the name of the mock functions, and the mock data.

The `generateList` function is used to generate a mock list of TableItems based on the number of rows and the price of each product.

Finally, the code exports the mock functions and the generated list, allowing other components to use these mock functions and test their behavior.

In summary, this code sets up a mock environment for testing a component that uses the `react-pdf` library to render a table with mock data. The mock functions can be easily replaced with real data during actual development.
---

## hooks.ts

This code defines several reusable hooks for fetching data in JavaScript/TypeScript. The `useSWR` hook is a custom hook that uses Swr.io to make HTTP requests and handle errors. The hook takes an array of URLs, query parameters, and a fetch function as arguments and returns an object containing the data, an error, and loading state.

The code includes several variations of this hook, each used for a specific purpose:

1. `useProducts`: Fetches the list of products based on the current session context.
2. `useProductList`: Fetches the list of products based on a given query parameter.
3. `useProductInfo`: Fetches detailed information about a specific product based on its ID.
4. `useOrder`: Fetches the order details based on the provided order ID.
5. `useShippingAndProductsInfo`: Fetches both the order and shipping information for that order.

These hooks are designed to be reusable across different components, ensuring that data is fetched consistently and efficiently. They also handle errors and loading states, providing a more robust and user-friendly experience.

The `fetcher` function is responsible for making the HTTP request and handling errors. It takes a URL and query parameter as arguments and returns the fetched response as an object containing JSON data.

These hooks and functions are part of a larger ecosystem of reusable components and utilities built on top of Swr.io, which simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and handling errors in large-scale applications.
---

## db.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code defines a `Db` interface and an `AppService` class that uses this interface. The purpose of the code is to provide a way to switch between different data storage backends (e.g., Firebase, MySQL) for an application.

Key functions:

1. Importing required dependencies: The code imports the `Db` interface and two different database implementations, one for Firebase and one for MySQL.
2. Defining a default database implementation: The code defines a default `Db` implementation (`firebaseDB`) that is used if no other backend is specified.
3. Switching between database implementations based on the environment: The code uses the `process.env.DB_TYPE` variable to determine which database implementation to use. If `DB_TYPE` is set to 'firebase', the code uses the Firebase database; otherwise, it uses the MySQL database.
4. Exporting the default database implementation: The code exports the default `Db` implementation so that it can be used throughout the application.

Usage:

The `AppService` class uses the `Db` interface to perform database operations. For example, the `AppService` class might use the `Db` interface to read and write data to the database. The specific implementation of the `Db` interface is determined by the value of the `DB_TYPE` environment variable.

This design allows developers to easily switch between different database backends without modifying the application code. Simply changing the value of the `DB_TYPE` environment variable will cause the application to use a different database implementation. This can be useful for development, testing, and production environments, or for migrating between different database providers.

In summary, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to manage database operations in an application. By using a simple interface and environment-based configuration, developers can easily switch between different database backends without modifying the application code.

6. `getStoreToken`: This function retrieves the access token for a specific store from the Firestore database. It takes a `SessionProps` object as an argument, which contains `storeHash`. The function returns the access token or null if it doesn't exist.

7. `deleteStore`: This function deletes the entire `/store` path in the Firestore database. It is useful for removing a store and all of its associated data.

These functions are useful for managing user data and store-specific variables in a Firebase Firestore database, and can be easily integrated into a server-side application built with TypeScript or JavaScript.
---

## load.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code imports necessary modules for authentication and URL building. The `buildRedirectUrl` function constructs a new URL by appending the encoded context to the existing path and query parameters.

The `load` function is the main entry point and is responsible for handling the request and response. It verifies the application's loading status by calling the `getBCVerify` function to retrieve the session. The session is then encoded as a payload using the `encodePayload` function, which ensures the signed JWT's integrity and prevents tampering.

Once the session is successfully set, the `res.redirect` function is called with a 302 status code, redirecting the user to the new URL constructed by the `buildRedirectUrl` function.

In case of an error, the `load` function catches it, logs the message and response, and returns an appropriate HTTP status code along with a JSON response containing the error message.
---

## uninstall.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code defines a function called `uninstall` that is used to uninstall a specific feature or component in a Next.js application. The code imports the necessary modules, including `NextApiRequest`, `NextApiResponse`, and `getBCVerify` from the `lib/auth` directory.

The `getBCVerify` function is used to retrieve the user's session data, while the `removeDataStore` function is used to delete the session data from the store.

The `uninstall` function takes two arguments: `req` and `res`. The `req` argument is an instance of the `NextApiRequest`, which contains information about the request being made to the server. The `res` argument is an instance of the `NextApiResponse`, which is used to send a response back to the client.

The function uses the `async` and `await` keywords to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from the server and deleting data from the store.

The code first retrieves the user's session data using the `getBCVerify` function. It then uses the `removeDataStore` function to delete the session data from the store. Finally, it sends a 200 status response back to the client.

If an error occurs during the deletion process, the function sends a 500 status response back to the client with the appropriate error message.

This code can be used in a `pages` directory to uninstall a specific feature or component in a Next.js application. It is important to note that the `getBCVerify` and `removeDataStore` functions should be defined in a separate file, such as `lib/auth.ts`.

By using this code, you can ensure that any unwanted data is deleted from the store when a feature or component is uninstalled from your Next.js application.
---

## removeUser.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code defines a function called `removeUser` that is exported for use in a Next.js application. The function accepts two arguments: `req` (a reference to the current API request) and `res` (a reference to the current API response).

The purpose of this code is to remove user data from the application's database when a user requests deletion. The `getBCVerify` function is imported from the `../../lib/auth` directory to retrieve the user's session data. The `removeUserData` function is also imported and used to delete the user's data from the application's storage.

The code uses an async/await pattern to handle the request and response. The `try` block contains the code that interacts with the user's data, while the `catch` block handles any errors that may occur during this process. The `res.status(200).end();` line is used to return a success status code to the client when the deletion is successful.

The `res.status(response?.status || 500).json({ message });` line is used to return an error response to the client when an error occurs during the deletion process. The `message` and `response` properties of the error object are used to provide detailed information about the error to the user.

In summary, this code defines a function that removes user data from the application's database when a user requests deletion. The code uses the `getBCVerify` and `removeUserData` functions to handle the user's data and returns a success or error response to the client based on the outcome of the deletion process.
---

## logout.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code exports a function named `logout` that is used to log out a user in a Next.js application. The function accepts two arguments: the `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` objects from the `next` library.

The purpose of this code is to log out the currently authenticated user, and it does so by using the `getSession` function from the `../../lib/auth` directory. This function retrieves the current session, if one exists.

Once the session is retrieved, the `logoutUser` function is called, which logs out the user. After logging out the user, the `NextApiResponse` object is used to return a 200 status code and an empty response body. This indicates that the logout request has been successfully handled.

However, if an error occurs during the logout process, the function will catch it and return a 500 status code along with a detailed error message in the response body.

In summary, this code is responsible for logging out a user in a Next.js application, ensuring that the user's authentication is properly managed and maintained.
---

## auth.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code defines an authentication function called `auth` that is used to secure the application's routes. The purpose of this function is to authenticate users and ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.

The function takes two arguments: `req` and `res`, which are objects representing the request and response, respectively.

The key functions used in this code are:

1. `getBCAuth`: This function is used to retrieve the user's authentication token from the query string. It returns a promise that resolves to the authentication token or an error object if the token cannot be retrieved.
2. `encodePayload`: This function is used to encode the user's authentication token as a signed JWT. This ensures that the token cannot be tampered with and can be verified by the server.
3. `setSession`: This function is used to set the user's authentication token in the browser's session storage. This allows the server to identify the user as they navigate through the application.
4. `res.redirect(302, `/?context=${encodedContext}`): This line of code redirects the user to a secure page that contains the encoded authentication token. This ensures that the user is always directed to a secure page after successful authentication.

The function first retrieves the user's authentication token from the query string. If the token cannot be retrieved, it throws an error and returns a 500 response with an error message.

Next, the function encodes the authentication token as a signed JWT using the `encodePayload` function. The encoded JWT is then stored in the browser's session storage using the `setSession` function.

Finally, the function redirects the user to a secure page that contains the encoded authentication token. This ensures that the user is always directed to a secure page after successful authentication.

In summary, this code is used to authenticate users and ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application. It uses a combination of functions to retrieve the user's authentication token, encode it as a signed JWT, and redirect the user to a secure page after successful authentication.

## [pid].ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code exports an async function called `products` that is used to handle HTTP requests for the products endpoint in a Next.js application. The function uses the `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` types from the `@next/api` package to ensure compatibility with the Next.js framework.

The code first imports necessary dependencies, including the `bigcommerceClient` function that uses the access token and store hash to interact with the BigCommerce API, and the `getSession` function that retrieves the access token and store hash from the request.

The `products` function takes two arguments: the `NextApiRequest` object and the `NextApiResponse` object. The function uses the `method` property of the `req` object to determine the HTTP method used in the request (GET, PUT, or other).

The function checks if the request is a GET request and retrieves the product ID (pid) from the query parameter. It then uses the `bigcommerceClient` function to make a GET request to the `/catalog/products/{pid}` endpoint of the BigCommerce API, passing the product ID as a parameter. The function waits for the response and extracts the data.

If the request is a PUT request, the function checks if the body is provided. It then uses the `bigcommerceClient` function to make a PUT request to the `/catalog/products/{pid}` endpoint of the BigCommerce API, passing the product data as a parameter. The function waits for the response and extracts the data.

The function returns a 200 status code with the data or an error message in case of a failure. It also sets the `Allow` header to allow only the specified HTTP methods (GET and PUT) for this endpoint.

This code ensures that the application follows the proper RESTful API conventions and handles different HTTP methods correctly. It also uses the BigCommerce API to fetch or update products based on the request method and the provided data.

## index.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code exports a function called `products` that is used to fetch product data from a BigCommerce store using the `next-auth-bigcommerce` library. The function takes two arguments: the `NextApiRequest` object (`req`) and the `NextApiResponse` object (`res`).

The purpose of this code is to retrieve product data and send it back to the server in the form of a JSON response. The data will be used by the frontend application to display products.

Here are some key functions in this code:

1. Importing necessary modules: The code imports the `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` classes from the `next` library, as well as the `bigcommerceClient` and `getSession` functions from the `../../../lib/auth` directory.
2. Retrieving session data: The `getSession` function is used to retrieve the access token and store hash from the request. This information is then passed to the `bigcommerceClient` function to establish a connection with the BigCommerce API.
3. Fetching product data: The `bigcommerceClient` function is used to fetch product data from the BigCommerce API using the `/catalog/summary` endpoint. The response is then passed to the `res` object and the status code is set to 200 (OK).
4. Handling errors: If an error occurs while fetching product data, the `error` object is passed to the `res` object and the status code is set to 500 (Internal Server Error). The error message is then sent back to the frontend application.

This code should be placed in a file named `products.js` and imported into the main application file. The `products` function should be called when the application needs to fetch product data from the BigCommerce store.

## list.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code defines a function called `list` that is used to fetch data from a BigCommerce API on behalf of a Next.js application. The purpose of this function is to handle the request and response for listing products in the BigCommerce store.

The function imports several required modules, including:

* `NextApiRequest`: Represents the HTTP request made by Next.js.
* `NextApiResponse`: Represents the HTTP response from the server.
* `URLSearchParams`: Allows you to create a URL search parameter object.
* `bigcommerceClient`: A function that creates a BigCommerce API client using an access token and store hash.

The function exports an asynchronous function that takes two arguments: `req` (the Next.js request object) and `res` (the Next.js response object).

The function fetches data from the BigCommerce API using the `bigcommerceClient` function with the access token and store hash. It then constructs a URL search parameter object using the `URLSearchParams` class with the `page`, `limit`, and any custom sorting and direction criteria provided by the user in the query string.

The `get` method of the `URLSearchParams` object is used to join the search parameters into a single query string, which is then passed along with the base URL for the BigCommerce API (/catalog/products) to the `bigcommerce.get` function.

The function returns a promise that resolves to the response from the BigCommerce API. If the request is successful, the response is converted to JSON and passed back to the `res` object with the status code 200. If the request fails or encounters an error, the response is discarded and the `res` object is updated with a custom error message and status code 500.

This function is designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into other parts of your Next.js application. It handles the HTTP request and response handling so that you can focus on processing the data received from the BigCommerce API.

## shipping_products.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code is an Express middleware that fetches shipping addresses and products from a BigCommerce API for a given order ID. The code uses the `next-auth` library to retrieve the access token and store hash for authentication purposes.

The function accepts two arguments: `req` and `res`. It first checks if the request method is GET. If so, it retrieves the shipping addresses and products using the BigCommerce API and passes them to the `res.json()` function to serialize the data and send it back to the client.

If the request method is not GET, the function sets the "Allow" header to a list of allowed methods (`['GET']`) and returns a 405 status code with an error message.

The code uses the `bigcommerceClient()` function to create a BigCommerce API client using the access token and store hash. The `get()` function is used to make API calls to retrieve shipping addresses and products.

The middleware should be mounted on an Express server in the following way:
```javascript
app.use(require('./middleware/shipping-addresses-and-products'));
```
This middleware is useful for fetching shipping addresses and products from a BigCommerce API for a given order ID in a secure and controlled manner. It ensures that only the GET method is allowed, and it provides detailed error messages for other methods.

## index.ts

This JavaScript/TypeScript code exports a function called `orderId` that is used to handle API requests for retrieving order details in a Next.js application. The function accepts two parameters: `req` and `res`, which represent the request and response objects, respectively.

The purpose of this code is to interact with the BigCommerce API to fetch order details based on the provided order ID. The code uses the `bigcommerceClient` function to establish a connection to the BigCommerce API using an access token and store hash.

The function first checks the request method and handles it accordingly:

1. If the request method is 'GET', the code fetches the order details using the BigCommerce API and sends the response back to the client.
2. If the request method is not 'GET', the code sets the `Allow` header to 'GET' and returns a 405 status code, indicating that the requested method is not supported.

The function also catches any errors that may occur during the API call and returns an error response with the appropriate message and status code.

To use this code, you need to import it in your Next.js application and replace the placeholders with your own BigCommerce API credentials and order ID.
